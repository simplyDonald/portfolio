          Hello! My name is Donald and I enjoy creating things that live on the
          internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I
          decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking
          together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
          Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an
          advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led
          design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible,
          inclusive products and digital experiences . I also recently launched
          a course that covers everything you need to build a web app with the
          Spotify API using Node & React. Here are a few technologies I’ve been
          working with recently: JavaScript (ES6+) TypeScript React Eleventy
          Node.js WordPress
